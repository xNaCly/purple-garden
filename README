purple_garden
=============

purple_garden is a minimal lisp I am attempting to make as fast possible.


Run

Currently there isn't much implemented, but you can test purple_garden as follows:

    # by default purple_garden fills $PG to be ./examples/hello-world.pg
    make

    # results in:
    # 
    #   N_LIST(
    #    N_LIST(
    #     N_IDENT[T_IDENT]('println'),
    #     N_ATOM[T_STRING]('Hello World')
    #    )
    #   )

    # provide a custom file to execute
    make PG=examples/ops.pg
